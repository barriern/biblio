Abstract = {Natural floating objects (NLOGs) are a major component of the habitat of
   pelagic species. Since the 1990s, the number of floating objects in the
   open ocean has increased greatly as a result of the introduction of
   drifting fish aggregating devices (DFADs) by the industrial tropical
   tuna purse seine vessels. These changes, and their potential impacts on
   the species that associate with floating objects, remain poorly
   understood. If the habitat modifications induced by DFADs have been
   recently characterized and quantified, the impact of other human
   activities on the number of floating objects is poorly studied. Relying
   on lagrangian simulations at the scale of the whole Indian Ocean, from
   2000 to 2019, we assess the potential modifications of the pelagic
   surface habitat that could originate from forest cover change and
   climate variations. We develop several scenarios, based on coastal and
   river forest cover, precipitations and river discharge, to simulate
   densities of NLOGs. Our results suggest no significant increase in
   average NLOG densities in the ocean and highlight important regional and
   seasonal variations of these densities driven by both forest cover
   change and precipitations. These preliminary findings underscore the
   limited understanding of this critical element of pelagic species
   habitat. Therefore, there is pressing need to intensify monitoring
   efforts for pelagic species habitat and raise awareness about potential
   impacts of habitat modifications on tuna and other pelagic species.},

Title = {Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of an ecosystem model for
   simulating food web dynamics in the Cooperation Sea, Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {285},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There is growing interest in developing and using ecosystem simulation
   models to advise fisheries management in the Southern Ocean. However,
   poor understanding of the impacts of uncertainty in ecosystem model
   parameters slows down progress towards operational ecosystem models. To
   address this issue, we explored uncertainty in the parameters estimated
   during the calibration of an OSMOSE ecosystem model for the Cooperation
   Sea ({''}OSMOSE-CooperationSea{''}) and the impacts of this uncertainty.
   Our investigations pertained to four types of calibrated parameters: (1)
   Plank.access, the proportion of the biomass of background species groups
   available to focal species groups; (2) Bioflux, the parameter
   controlling the flux of migratory species group biomasses across the
   modelled domain boundaries; (3) Mlarval, the instantaneous larval
   mortality of the focal species groups; and (4) Mnatural, the additional
   natural mortality of the focal species groups. Results with the Morris
   method suggested that the community in the Cooperation Sea was most
   sensitive to changes in the Mlarval parameter of mesopelagic fishes. The
   biomasses of large-size, long-lived species such as toothfishes,
   Ade<acute accent>lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), seals, and whales
   were most sensitive to the parameters specific to these species groups.
   By contrast, the biomasses of small-sized, short-lived species such as
   mesopelagic fishes and krill species were most sensitive to changes in
   the parameters specific to the predators of these species groups. Monte
   Carlo simulations indicated that community dynamics were more sensitive
   to the Mlarvaland Mnatural parameters than to the Plank.access and
   Bioflux parameters. After gradually increasing the Mlarvalor Mnatural
   parameter, the biomasses of Ade<acute accent>lie penguin, seals and
   whales decreased, while the biomasses of mesopelagic fishes and
   Antarctic krill increased. By providing a comprehensive analysis of
   uncertainty in the parameters estimated during the calibration process,
   the present study represents an important step towards an operational
   ecosystem model for supporting ecosystem-based management in the
   Cooperation Sea. The present study will serve as a valuable basis for
   similar ecosystem modelling efforts in the Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Which processes structure global pelagic ecosystems and control their

Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Pelagic ecosystems are distributed throughout the world's seas and
   oceans. They are characterised by strong vertical structuring,
   horizontal heterogeneity and temporal variability, which pose
   significant challenges for modelling them on a global scale. In this
   paper, we use the mechanistic high trophic level model APECOSM (Apex
   Predators ECOSystem Model) to assess how the physical and biogeochemical
   environment constrains the structure and trophic functioning of pelagic
   ecosystems worldwide. To this end, we configure the model to represent
   the three-dimensional and size-structured dynamics of six generic
   pelagic communities: small and medium epipelagics, tropical tunas,
   mesopelagic feeding tunas, small coastal pelagics, mesopelagic residents
   and mesopelagic migrants. We analyse their emergent three-dimensional
   spatial structuring on a global scale. We first show that the modelled
   horizontal and vertical distributions are consistent with the observed
   data. We then analyse the role of key environmental drivers, such as
   temperature, light, primary production, currents and oxygen on the
   response of the communities. Finally, we explore the trophic functioning
   of pelagic ecosystems, focusing on the emergent diets of communities and
   their variation with organism size. This study demonstrates the ability
   of a mechanistic ecosystem model to represent the multidimensional
   structural heterogeneity of marine ecosystems globally (encompassing
   three-dimensional distribution, size variations, and community
   composition) from a small set of universal principles and well-defined
   hypotheses. This approach helps to understand how the various processes
   at stake act and interact to shape the structure of global pelagic
   ecosystems, and eventually elucidate the heterogeneity of their trophic
   functioning.},

Title = {Effects of regional oceanography and climate variability on larval

   American beaches},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {321},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {The wedge clam, Donax hanleyanus, inhabits sandy beaches in the
   subtropical and temperate regions of the Atlantic coast of South
   America. Its distribution spans over 20 degrees of latitude from Brazil
   to Argentina, with the southernmost part of its range being influenced
   by the Rio de la Plata (RdlP) estuary, which limits the southward larval
   expansion. We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the larval
   connectivity patterns of the wedge clam during the period 2000-2012. The
   IBM combines a 3D hydrodynamic model with a biological sub-model that
   considers larval mortality due to low salinity (<7, and <9) and sea
   surface temperature range (high >30 degrees C or low <9 degrees C). The
   main larval connectivity patterns were observed near the
   release/recruitment areas, suggesting a high potential for
   self-recruitment. Based on the IBM and adult abundance data, we also
   identified the likely source and sink areas within this metapopulation.
   Source beach areas were Navegantes and Cassino in Brazil (from 26.3
   degrees S to 34.34 degrees S), Arachania in Uruguay (34.56 degrees S),
   and Santa Teresita in Argentina (37.15 degrees S). A low probability of
   larval transport towards the poleward limit of the species' distribution
   was observed, supporting an irregular recruitment pattern typical of
   sink populations located at the edge of the distribution range of
   metapopulations. Larval mortality due to warm or cold waters did not
   affect connectivity patterns for this subtropical species. Southward
   larval transport across the RdlP estuary (from Uruguayan to Argentine
   beaches) only occurred for larvae released on early January 2011,
   concurrently with the strongest La Ni \& ntilde;a year observed during
   the study period. In light of a changing climate, marked by potential
   increases in extreme La Ni \& ntilde;a events and a poleward shift of
   atmospheric circulation patterns over the South Atlantic, we anticipate
   a strengthening of larval transport across the RdlP and a subsequent
   poleward expansion of the species' distribution range.},

abstract = {Abstract The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) has dedicated a decade to unraveling the future impacts of climate change on marine animal biomass. FishMIP is now preparing a new simulation protocol to assess the combined effects of both climate and socio-economic changes on marine fisheries and ecosystems. This protocol will be based on the Ocean System Pathways (OSPs), a new set of socio-economic scenarios derived from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) widely used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The OSPs extend the SSPs to the economic, governance, management and socio-cultural contexts of large pelagic, small pelagic, benthic-demersal and emerging fisheries, as well as mariculture. Comprising qualitative storylines, quantitative model driver pathways and a “plug-in-model” framework, the OSPs will enable a heterogeneous suite of ecosystem models to simulate fisheries dynamics in a standardised way. This paper introduces this OSP framework and the simulation protocol that FishMIP will implement to explore future ocean social-ecological systems holistically, with a focus on critical issues such as climate justice, global food security, equitable fisheries, aquaculture development, fisheries management, and biodiversity conservation. Ultimately, the OSP framework is tailored to contribute to the synthesis work of the IPCC. It also aims to inform ongoing policy processes within the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Finally, it seeks to support the synthesis work of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), with a particular focus on studying pathways relevant for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.},

abstract = {Systematic analysis of uncertainty is critical for consolidating ecosystem model projections. Sensitivity analysis is an essential step in understanding model uncertainty, but there are many challenges when dealing with complex models. One of these is related to the quantification of uncertainty in model input parameters, which is especially problematic when limited data leads to the use of arbitrary fixed ranges of variation to define parameter uncertainty. We show the drawbacks of this practice and propose an alternative approach based on the parameter reliability criterion. This criterion helps to classify the model parameters according to the source of information used to estimate their values and calculate the ranges of variability for each parameter used in a sensitivity analysis. Our proposed approach presented in this protocol is illustrated by implementing a sensitivity analysis of the OSMOSE marine ecosystem modelling platform applied to the northern Peru Current ecosystem. We compare the results from the sensitivity analysis based on the parameter reliability criterion with those obtained using fixed ranges of variation. We find that using arbitrary uncertainty ranges can produce different conclusions compared to alternative approaches, such as the one based on the reliability of the parameters. The parameter reliability criterion can be helpful in situations where direct quantification of uncertainty in model inputs is not available.}

Fundamental physiological thermal performance curves (TPCs), determined under controlled conditions, are commonly used to project future species spatial distributions or physiological performances. Yet, real-world performances may deviate due to extrinsic factors covarying with temperature (food, oxygen, etc.). Using a bioenergetic marine ecosystem model, we evaluate the differences between fundamental and realised TPCs for fish species with contrasted ecology and thermal preferences. Food limitation is the primary cause of differences, decreasing throughout ontogeny and across trophic levels due to spatio-temporal variability of low-trophic level prey availability with temperature. Deoxygenation has moderate impact, despite increasing during ontogeny. This highlights the lower sensitivity of early life stages to hypoxia, which is mechanistically explained by lower mass-specific ingestion at older stages. Understanding the emergence of realised thermal niches offers crucial insights to better determine population's persistence under climate warming.},

Essential knowledge about the drivers of Sargassum growth and decay is still lacking to explain this interannual variability. Benefiting from accurate basin scale Sargassum detections provided by remote sensing, and from physical and biogeochemical ocean simulations, we developed a Lagrangian drift-growth model to simulate Sargassum distribution over the period 2016–2020. The resulting trajectories and biomass time series of Sargassum aggregates were analyzed to highlight the main limiting factors of growth and decay. The nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations are found to be weakly restrictive compared to physical limiting factors, especially the temperature. In particular, the warm waters found off northern Brazil appear to be instrumental in triggering the end of seasonal growth of Sargassum. The timing of the seasonal warming of this region strongly impacts the quantities of Sargassum simulated each year. This suggests that this region should be monitored to anticipate the development of Sargassum and resulting strandings.}

abstract = {Abstract The recruitment of marine species in isolated oceanic island systems can be challenged by prevailing currents, as exemplified by the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic. In this region, the Fernando de Noronha ridge hosts several seamounts, the Rocas Atoll and the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, which are home to great marine biodiversity. However, along the ridge, the central branch of the South Equatorial Current (cSEC), flowing westward, poses a challenge to the recruitment of organisms toward Fernando de Noronha. To unveil critical insights into the intricate processes shaping biodiversity in these insular ecosystems, we use a dispersal Lagrangian tool to explore the role of diel vertical migration (DVM) to depth strata influenced by the South Equatorial Undercurrent (SEUC), which flows eastward bellow the cSEC, in shaping species dispersal and metacommunity dynamics. Our results show that while not a direct journey, the DVM into SEUC-influenced strata increases the possibility that the seamounts and the Rocas Atoll act as stepping stones between the continental shelf and Fernando de Noronha. Propagules of organisms originating primarily from the continental shelf are transported to the western seamounts of the ridge. Upon reaching the western seamounts, organisms can find suitable habitats to recruit. The progeny of these communities that migrate to SEUC-influenced strata have the opportunity to reach suitable habitats at the Rocas Atoll and the Eastern seamounts, ultimately connecting to the Fernando de Noronha archipelago. These results provide scientific fundaments for the development of a functional network of marine protected areas in the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic.},

abstract = {The Yellow Sea is a marginal sea in the Northwestern Pacific where the fishery resources have been overfished and the community structure has greatly changed over the past six decades. Ecosystem modeling approaches are valuable tools to uncover potential mechanisms behind the ecosystem changes. Here, we developed ‘OSMOSE-YS’, an individual-based multi-species OSMOSE model that includes important commercial pelagic and demersal fish and invertebrates in the Yellow Sea. Simulations were carried out under three fishing scenarios to investigate how different levels of fishing pressure may have impacted the Yellow Sea ecosystem. Results indicate that the biomass of demersal fish continued to decline during 1970–2014, while the biomass of pelagic fish and invertebrates fluctuated periodically. Long-term fishing pressure has led to the reduction of total biomass, body sizes, and longevity of the modelled species. Under low-fishing condition, the ecosystem biomass is restored and the proportion of elder and larger individuals increases. On the contrary, high-fishing condition further decreases the proportion of high-trophic-level species. OSMOSE-YS serves as a baseline model to investigate ecosystem responses to different fishing strategies, in support of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Yellow Sea.}

    abstract = {Marine animal biomass is expected to decrease in the 21st century due to climate driven changes in ocean environmental conditions. Previous studies suggest that the magnitude of the decline in primary production on apex predators could be amplified through the trophodynamics of marine food webs, leading to larger decreases in the biomass of predators relative to the decrease in primary production, a mechanism called trophic amplification. We compared relative changes in producer and consumer biomass or production in the global ocean to assess the extent of trophic amplification. We used simulations from nine marine ecosystem models (MEMs) from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Models Intercomparison Project forced by two Earth System Models under the high greenhouse gas emissions Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5) and a scenario of no fishing. Globally, total consumer biomass is projected to decrease by 16.7 ± 9.5% more than net primary production (NPP) by 2090–2099 relative to 1995–2014, with substantial variations among MEMs and regions. Total consumer biomass is projected to decrease almost everywhere in the ocean (80% of the world’s oceans) in the model ensemble. In 40% of the world’s oceans, consumer biomass was projected to decrease more than NPP. Additionally, in another 36% of the world’s oceans consumer biomass is expected to decrease even as projected NPP increases. By analysing the biomass response within food webs in available MEMs, we found that model parameters and structures contributed to more complex responses than a consistent amplification of climate impacts of higher trophic levels. Our study provides additional insights into the ecological mechanisms that will impact marine ecosystems, thereby informing model and scenario development.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate change scenarios suggest that large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be required to maintain global warming below 2°C, leading to renewed attention on ocean iron fertilization (OIF). Previous OIF modelling has found that while carbon export increases, nutrient transport to lower latitude ecosystems declines, resulting in a modest impact on atmospheric CO2. However, the interaction of these CDR responses with ongoing climate change is unknown. Here, we combine global ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem models to show that, while stimulating carbon sequestration, OIF may amplify climate-induced declines in tropical ocean productivity and ecosystem biomass under a high-emission scenario, with very limited potential atmospheric CO2 drawdown. The ‘biogeochemical fingerprint’ of climate change, that leads to depletion of upper ocean major nutrients due to upper ocean stratification, is reinforced by OIF due to greater major nutrient consumption. Our simulations show that reductions in upper trophic level animal biomass in tropical regions due to climate change would be exacerbated by OIF within ~20 years, especially in coastal exclusive economic zones (EEZs), with potential implications for fisheries that underpin the livelihoods and economies of coastal communities. Any fertilization-based CDR should therefore consider its interaction with ongoing climate-driven changes and the ensuing ecosystem impacts in national EEZs.}

abstract = {Tropical tuna purse-seine fisheries deploy thousands of human-made drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs) annually, raising a number of concerns regarding ecosystem impacts. In this study, we explored the use of a Lagrangian particle-tracking model to simulate the drift of dFADs in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. We simulated more than 100,000 dFADs trajectories using the Lagrangian tool Ichthyop forced with velocity fields from an ocean model output (GLORYS12V1) and two satellite-derived ocean currents products (OSCAR and GEKCO). Importantly, through a collaborative agreement with the French frozen tuna producers’ organization we had access to the true locations of all dFADs along their drift and could therefore evaluate the accuracy of our simulations. The accuracy was assessed by comparing the observed and simulated trajectories in terms of spatial distribution, separation distance, and a non-dimensional skill score (an index based on separation distances normalized by net displacements of dFADs). In the two oceans, simulations forced with GLORYS12V1 were more accurate than with OSCAR and GEKCO, probably due to the differences in the spatio-temporal resolution of the forcing products. When we compared multiple depths for GLORYS12V1, the model performed better at 0 m in the Indian Ocean and at 5 m in the Atlantic Ocean, which could be related to the longer vertical structure of dFADs in the Atlantic Ocean. We showed that including a windage factor did not improve the accuracy of modeled dFADs trajectories. We found that mean model-data separation distances were similar in both oceans, exceeding 100 km after 6–8 days of drift. While separation distances between simulated and observed trajectories show that model errors were similar in the two oceans, the generally longer distances traveled by dFADs in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean lead to considerably higher skill scores in the former than in the latter. This explains the relatively good predictive ability of the model to represent mean dFAD densities at the basin scale in both oceans, while at the same time indicates higher prediction skills for the movements of individual dFADs in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic Ocean.}

In particular, El Niño years are characterized, among other things, by a decrease in tuna catches in the western Pacific and an increase in the central Pacific, whereas these catches accumulate in the far western Pacific during La Niña conditions. However, the processes driving this zonal shift in the tuna catch (changing habitat conditions, currents or food availability) remain unclear. Here, we use an hindcast simulation from the mechanistic ecosystem model APECOSM that reasonably reproduces the observed zonal shift of the epipelagic community in response to ENSO to understand the mechanisms underlying this shift. Although the response of modeled epipelagic communities to El Niño is relatively similar for the different size classes studied, the processes responsible for these changes vary considerably by organism size. One of the major results of our analysis is the critical role of eastward passive transport by El Niño-related surface current anomalies for all size classes. While the effects of passive transport dominate the effects of growth and predation changes for large organisms, this is not the case for intermediate-sized organisms in the western Pacific, where the decrease in biomass is first explained by increased predation and then decreased foraging success. For small organisms, changes in growth rate, induced by the influence of temperature on fish physiology, is an important process that reinforces the biomass increase induced by passive horizontal transport in the eastern Pacific and the biomass decrease induced by increased predation by intermediate-sized organisms near the dateline. Finally, contrary to what is often assumed, our model shows that active habitat-based movements are not required to explain the westward biomass shifts that are observed during ENSO. This study illustrates the relevance of using a mechanistic ecosystem model to disentangle the role of the different processes controlling biomass changes. It highlights the essential dynamic role of ocean currents in shaping the response of marine communities to climate variability and its interaction with biological (e.g. growth) and ecological (e.g. foraging and predation) processes, whose relative importance varies with organisms’ size and contribute to modify the community structure.}

	abstract = {Cooperation between countries in managing and protecting shared marine resources is beneficial both ecologically and economically, but how best to establish the cooperation needed at a global scale is largely unknown. Here, we used hydrodynamic modelling to identify ecologically connected networks of marine reserves (MRs) and evaluated these networks with socio-economic indicators. Most of the networks are homogenous with similar levels of development, shared languages, and other cultural values. However, we found that 17\% (11/66) of the largest networks (\&gt;20 MRs) span multiple countries. These heterogenous networks are composed of countries with different economic, political, and cultural views. Countries that control more, larger marine reserves also have a more even ratio of source reserves to sinks. We discuss that, while such economic and cultural homogeneity might lead to more efficient ecological management in the short term, heterogeneous networks may prove to be more resilient in the longer term, when climate change will modify marine connectivity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

ABSTRACT={Hatchery programs are commonly used to enhance fishery stocks, while the efforts to minimize potential negative ecological impacts have grown in recent years. In China, Fenneropenaeus chinensis is a fast-growing, short-lived shrimp species with a high commercial value. F. chinensis fishery is heavily dependent on the hatchery program. We evaluated the trade-off between economic profits and ecological impacts of F. chinensis hatchery program in the Jiaozhou Bay of China. The total length of released individuals was 1.4 cm. The results showed that artificially released F. chinensis individuals experienced high predation pressure during the first 2 weeks. The economic profit peaked when 198 million individuals were released. The modeled hatchery program yielded a lower proportion of individuals with the increasing amount of F. chinensis release. The temporally uniform hatchery release was more efficient than other hatchery release scenarios (e.g., increasing the released amount year by year) in a long-term hatchery program. F. chinensis had the negative impacts on two large predatory fishes. Large fishes recovered at a slower rate than small fishes after the F. chinensis release stopped. Reducing fishing pressure could offset negative impacts of F. chinensis release on large fishes. The study indicates that the effectiveness of F. chinensis release cannot be enhanced by simply increasing the released amount. A long-term F. chinensis hatchery program with a large released amount may present additional challenges for managing natural resources in an ecosystem context.}

ABSTRACT={Pelagic fish communities are shaped by bottom-up and top-down processes, transport by currents, and active swimming. However, the interaction of these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we use a regional implementation of the APex ECOSystem Model (APECOSM), a mechanistic model of the pelagic food web, to investigate these processes in the California Current, a highly productive upwelling system characterized by vigorous mesoscale circulation. The model is coupled with an eddy-resolving representation of ocean currents and lower trophic levels, and is tuned to reproduce observed fish biomass from fisheries independent trawls. Several emergent properties of the model compare realistically with observations. First, the epipelagic community accounts for one order of magnitude less biomass than the vertically migratory community, and is composed by smaller species. Second, the abundance of small fish decreases from the coast to the open ocean, while the abundance of large fish remains relatively uniform. This in turn leads to flattening of biomass size-spectra away from the coast for both communities. Third, the model reproduces a cross-shore succession of small to large sizes moving offshore, consistent with observations of species occurrence. These cross-shore variations emerge in the model from a combination of: (1) passive offshore advection by the mean current, (2) active swimming toward coastal productive regions to counterbalance this transport, and (3) mesoscale heterogeneity that reduces the ability of organisms to return to coastal waters. Our results highlight the importance of passive and active movement in structuring the pelagic food web, and suggest that a representation of these processes can help to improve the realism in simulations with marine ecosystem models.}

The region is influenced by the Rio de la Plata (RdlP), which represents a zoogeographic barrier that restricts its larval exchange. We investigated yellow clam larval connectivity patterns using an individual based model (IBM). The IBM combined outputs from a 3D hydrodynamic model with a clam submodel that considered salinity- and temperature-dependent mortality for the planktonic larvae. Connectivity across the RdlP estuary occurred only for larvae released in spring during a strong La Niña event. Mortality due to freshwater precluded larval transport across the RdlP, whereas larval mortality induced by warmer waters reduced connectivity, leading to self-recruitment in most areas. Warming acceleration in this hotspot could further restrict larval connectivity between populations in the SAO, with conservation implications for this threatened species.}

abstract = {In face of global changes, projecting and mapping biodiversity changes are of critical importance to support management and conservation measures of marine ecosystems. Despite the development of a wide variety of ecosystem models capable of integrating an increasing number of ecological processes, most projections of climate-induced changes in marine biodiversity are based on species distribution models (SDMs). These correlative models present a significant advantage when the lack of knowledge on the species physiology is counterbalanced by the availability of relevant environmental variables over the species geographical range. However, correlative SDMs neglect intra- and inter-specific interactions and thereby can lead to biased projections of changes in biodiversity distribution. To evaluate the influence of trophic interactions on projections of species richness and assemblage composition under climate change scenarios, we compared biodiversity projections derived from an ensemble of different SDMs to projections derived from a hybrid model coupling SDMs and a multispecies trophic model in the Mediterranean Sea. Our results show that accounting for trophic interactions modifies projections of future biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, SDMs tended to overestimate the gains and underestimate the losses of species richness by the end of the 21st century, with marked local differences in projections, both in terms of magnitude and trend, in some biodiversity hotspots. In both SDMs and hybrid approaches, nestedness with gains in species richness was the main pattern driving dissimilarity between present and future fish and macro-invertebrate species assemblages at the Mediterranean basin scale. However, at local scale, we highlighted some differences in the relative contribution of nestedness vs replacement in driving dissimilarity. Our results call for the development of integrated modelling tools that can mechanistically consider multiple biotic and abiotic drivers to improve projections of future marine biodiversity.}

abstract = {Climate change is warming the ocean and impacting lower trophic level (LTL) organisms. Marine ecosystem models can provide estimates of how these changes will propagate to larger animals and impact societal services such as fisheries, but at present these estimates vary widely. A better understanding of what drives this inter-model variation will improve our ability to project fisheries and other ecosystem services into the future, while also helping to identify uncertainties in process understanding. Here, we explore the mechanisms that underlie the diversity of responses to changes in temperature and LTLs in eight global marine ecosystem models from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP). Temperature and LTL impacts on total consumer biomass and ecosystem structure (defined as the relative change of small and large organism biomass) were isolated using a comparative experimental protocol. Total model biomass varied between -35% to +3% in response to warming, and -17% to +15% in response to LTL changes. There was little consensus about the spatial redistribution of biomass or changes in the balance between small and large organisms (ecosystem structure) in response to warming, and LTL impacts on total consumer biomass varied depending on the choice of LTL forcing terms. Overall, climate change impacts on consumer biomass and ecosystem structure are well approximated by the sum of temperature and LTL impacts, indicating an absence of nonlinear interaction between the models’ drivers. Our results highlight a lack of theoretical clarity about how to represent fundamental ecological mechanisms, most importantly how temperature impacts scale from individual to ecosystem level, and the need to better understand the two-way coupling between LTL organisms and consumers. We finish by identifying future research needs to strengthen global marine ecosystem modelling and improve projections of climate change impacts.}

ABSTRACT={Extreme weather events affect coastal marine ecosystems. The increase in intensity and occurrence of such events drive modifications in coastal hydrology and hydrodynamics. Here, focusing on the winter period (from December to March), we investigated multi-decade (2000–2018) changes in the hydrological properties of the Bay of Brest (French Atlantic coast) as an example of the response of a semi-enclosed bay to extreme weather episodes and large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. The relationships between extreme weather events and severe low salinity conditions (as a proxy for changes in water density) were investigated using high-frequency in situ observations and high-resolution numerical simulations. The identification of intense episodes was based on the timing, duration, and annual occurrence of extreme events. By examining the interannual variability of extreme low salinity events, we detect a patent influence of local and regional weather conditions on atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, precipitation, and river runoff. We revealed that low salinity events in Brittany were controlled by large-scale forcings: they prevailed during the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and periods of low occurrences of the Atlantic Ridge weather regime. The increase in severe storms observed in western France since 2010 has led to a doubling of the occurrence and duration of extreme low salinity events in Brittany.}

Migratory species moving into and out of an ecosystem may influence the dynamics of local fish communities and SSFs. We used the end-to-end model, OSMOSE-JZB (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystEms), to evaluate the impacts of fishing and a migratory shrimp (Trachypenaeus curvirostris) on the ecosystem of Jiaozhou Bay, China. Increased fishing intensity (i.e., annual fishing effort) resulted in the decline of four ecological indicators, including the total biomass of the community, mean trophic level of the community, inverse fishing pressure, and large fish index. Compared to managing fish stocks under uniform fishing mortality over the fishing season, landings and community biomass were higher when a “race to fish” (i.e., large catches in a short period) occurred. The results suggested that managing fishing seasonality (i.e., temporal allocation of fishing effort) could mitigate the negative impact of fishing intensity. Two resident high-trophic-level fishes were sensitive to changes in fishing intensity and fishing seasonality. The changes in trophic interactions had larger impacts on species at low trophic levels than fishing. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that T. curvirostris biomass was negatively correlated with the biomass of resident species and positively correlated with the biomass of other migratory species. We also found that fishing changed the impact of varying T. curvirostris migratory biomass on other species. Resident species were more sensitive to changes in fishing and T. curvirostris migratory biomass than other migratory species. We argue that SSFs management can benefit from the development of temporal fishing strategies and consideration of trophic interactions stemming from migratory species dynamics.}

This approach yields a model in which geostrophic eddies are quasi-adiabatic in the ocean interior, so that the residual-mean overturning circulation aligns almost perfectly with density contours. A reentrant channel configuration of the MIT General Circulation Model, that approximates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is used to examine these issues.

Our results show that the strongest correlation between SSH and weather regimes is found with the so-called Atlantic-Ridge (AR) while no significant values are obtained for the other regimes, including those related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), known as the primary actor of the Atlantic dynamics. Wintertime AR events are characterized by anticyclonic wind anomalies off Europe leading to a northward shift of the climatological wind-stress curl. The latter affects subtropical SSH annual variability by altered Sverdrup balance and ocean Rossby wave dynamics propagating westward from the African coast towards the Caribbean. The use of a simple linear planetary geostrophic model allows to quantify those effects and confirms the primary importance of the winter season to explain the largest part of SSH interannual variability in the Atlantic subtropical gyre.

	abstract = {A new framework is proposed for investigating the atmospheric forcing of North Atlantic Ocean circulation. Instead of using classical modes of variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or the east Atlantic pattern, the weather regimes paradigm was used. Using this framework helped avoid problems associated with the assumptions of orthogonality and symmetry that are particular to modal analysis and known to be unsuitable for the NAO. Using ocean-only historical and sensitivity experiments, the impacts of the four winter weather regimes on horizontal and overturning circulations were investigated. The results suggest that the Atlantic Ridge (AR), negative NAO (NAO−), and positive NAO (NAO+) regimes induce a fast (monthly-to-interannual time scales) adjustment of the gyres via topographic Sverdrup dynamics and of the meridional overturning circulation via anomalous Ekman transport. The wind anomalies associated with the Scandinavian blocking regime (SBL) are ineffective in driving a fast wind-driven oceanic adjustment. The response of both gyre and overturning circulations to persistent regime conditions was also estimated. AR causes a strong, wind-driven reduction in the strengths of the subtropical and subpolar gyres, while NAO+ causes a strengthening of the subtropical gyre via wind stress curl anomalies and of the subpolar gyre via heat flux anomalies. NAO− induces a southward shift of the gyres through the southward displacement of the wind stress curl. The SBL is found to impact the subpolar gyre only via anomalous heat fluxes. The overturning circulation is shown to spin up following persistent SBL and NAO+ and to spin down following persistent AR and NAO− conditions. These responses are driven by changes in deep water formation in the Labrador Sea.},

	abstract = {There is now a strong scientific consensus that coastal marine systems of Western Europe are highly sensitive to the combined effects of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. However, it still remains challenging to assess the spatial and temporal scales at which climate influence operates. While large-scale hydro-climatic indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or the East Atlantic Pattern (EAP) and the weather regimes such as the Atlantic Ridge (AR), are known to be relevant predictors of physical processes, changes in coastal waters can also be related to local hydro-meteorological and geochemical forcing. Here, we study the temporal variability of physical and chemical characteristics of coastal waters located at about 48°N over the period 1998–2013 using (1) sea surface temperature, (2) sea surface salinity and (3) nutrient concentration observations for two coastal sites located at the outlet of the Bay of Brest and off Roscoff, (4) river discharges of the major tributaries close to these two sites and (5) regional and local precipitation data over the region of interest. Focusing on the winter months, we characterize the physical and chemical variability of these coastal waters and document changes in both precipitation and river runoffs. Our study reveals that variability in coastal waters is connected to the large-scale North Atlantic atmospheric circulation but is also partly explained by local river influences. Indeed, while the NAO is strongly related to changes in sea surface temperature at the Brest and Roscoff sites, the EAP and the AR have a major influence on precipitations, which in turn modulate river discharges that impact sea surface salinity at the scale of the two coastal stations.},

	abstract = {In the mid 1990s, the North Atlantic subpolar gyre has shown a dramatic warming event that has been thoroughly investigated from observations and numerical simulations. Some studies suggest that it was due to an interannual, wind-driven weakening and shrinking of the gyre that facilitated the penetration of warm Atlantic Water, the weakening of the gyre being attributed to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and in the East Atlantic Pattern, which are the two dominant modes of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic. However, other studies suggest that the warming event was due to a decadal, buoyancy-driven strengthening of the meridional overturning circulation and subsequent intensification of the poleward heat transport, in response to the positive NAO conditions of 1988–1995. To reconcile this discrepancy, the heat budget in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is reconstructed from four ocean hindcast simulations sharing the same modelling platform but using different settings. The novelty of this work is the decomposition of the subpolar gyre into a western and an eastern subregion, which is motivated by water mass distribution around Reykjanes Ridge and by the fact that deep convection only occurs in the western subpolar gyre. In the western subpolar gyre, the 1995 warming event is the decadal, baroclinic ocean response to positive NAO conditions from 1988 to 1995. The latter induced increased surface heat loss in the Labrador Sea that intensified deep convection hence strengthened the meridional overturning circulation and the associated poleward heat transport. In the eastern subregion, a concomittant warming is induced by an interannual, barotropic adjustment of the gyre circulation to an abrupt switch from positive NAO conditions in winter 1995 to negative NAO conditions in winter 1996. Indeed, the gyre response to negative NAO conditions is a cyclonic intergyre-gyre that increases northward volume and heat transports at the southeastern limit of the subpolar gyre. Therefore, the discrepancies found in the literature about the 1995 warming event of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre are reconciled in the present work, which suggests that the atmospheric drivers, the mechanisms at stake and the associated timescales are different to the east and to the west of Reykjanes Ridge.},

	abstract = {The Northern Mediterranean Current is the return branch of the cyclonic circulation of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope of the Gulf of Lion. But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on the eastern part of the gulf are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the Gulf of Lion coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and are related to the development of upwellings along the Gulf of Lion coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the Gulf of Lion shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the intrusions permits to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Lion.},

	abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems worldwide are not only highly affected by the effects of human activities, but also by the influence of natural climate variability and global climate change. However, it is still a challenge to assess the spatial and temporal scales at which forcings operate and their persistence over time, to determine the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems to climate changes and climate extreme events, and therefore to anticipate the ecological and biological responses of these areas. By investigating these knowledge gaps, our recent studies have shown that the combination of large- and local-scale hydro-climatic influences have induced obvious changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of coastal waters in Western Europe. Because of the complex and non-linear climate-coastal ecosystem relationships, a thorough understanding of the underlying processes is still needed, while extending the spatial and temporal scales of inference. Here, using both high- and low-frequency observations collected from 1998 onwards at the outlet of the Bay of Brest and off Roscoff, we described and documented monthly changes in (1) sea surface temperature, (2) sea surface salinity, (3) river discharges and (4) precipitation patterns. By focusing on the winter period (from December to February), our study revealed that coastal waters of Western Europe are not only significantly connected to large-scale atmospheric conditions and patterns, but also to local-scale drivers such as river discharges. Current strong impacts of regional climate extreme events worldwide led us to devote more attention on understanding the possible impacts of such episodes on the long-term variability and trends of these ecosystems in coastal waters of Western Europe. The signature of extreme events in the Bay of Brest is described and the numerical simulations allowed us to highlight the link between local rivers and changes in salinity.},

	abstract = {Earth System Models project that global climate change will reduce ocean net primary production (NPP), upper trophic level biota biomass and potential fisheries catches in the future, especially in the eastern equatorial Pacific. However, projections from Earth System Models are undermined by poorly constrained assumptions regarding the biological cycling of iron, which is the main limiting resource for NPP over large parts of the ocean. In this study, we show that the climate change trends in NPP and the biomass of upper trophic levels are strongly affected by modifying assumptions associated with phytoplankton iron uptake. Using a suite of model experiments, we find 21st century climate change impacts on regional NPP range from −12.3\% to +2.4\% under a high emissions climate change scenario. This wide range arises from variations in the efficiency of iron retention in the upper ocean in the eastern equatorial Pacific across different scenarios of biological iron uptake, which affect the strength of regional iron limitation. Those scenarios where nitrogen limitation replaced iron limitation showed the largest projected NPP declines, while those where iron limitation was more resilient displayed little future change. All model scenarios have similar skill in reproducing past inter-annual variations in regional ocean NPP, largely due to limited change in the historical period. Ultimately, projections of end of century upper trophic level biomass change are altered by 50\%–80\% across all plausible scenarios. Overall, we find that uncertainties in the biological iron cycle cascade through open ocean pelagic ecosystems, from plankton to fish, affecting their evolution under climate change. This highlights additional challenges to developing effective conservation and fisheries management policies under climate change.},

	abstract = {Understanding larval connectivity patterns is critical for marine spatial planning, particularly for designing marine protected areas and managing fisheries. Patterns of larval dispersal and connectivity can be inferred from numerical transport models at large spatial and temporal scales. We assess model-based connectivity patterns between seamounts of the Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) and the coastal ecosystems of Mauritius, La Réunion, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa, with emphasis on three shallow seamounts (La Pérouse [LP], MAD-Ridge [MR] and Walters Shoal [WS]). Using drifter trajectory and a Lagrangian model of ichthyoplankton dispersal, we show that larvae can undertake very long dispersion, with larval distances increasing with pelagic larval duration (PLD). There are three groups of greater connectivity: the region between the eastern coast of Madagascar, Mauritius and La Réunion islands; the seamounts of the South West Indian Ridge; and the pair formed by WS and a nearby un-named seamount. Connectivity between these three groups is evident only for the longest PLD examined (360 d). Connectivity from seamounts to coastal ecosystems is weak, with a maximum of 2\% of larvae originating from seamounts reaching coastal ecosystems. Local retention at the three focal seamounts (LP, MR and WS) peaks at about 11\% for the shortest PLD considered (15 d) at the most retentive seamount (WS) and decreases sharply with increasing PLD. Information on PLD and age of larvae collected at MR and LP are used to assess their putative origin. These larvae are likely self-recruits but it is also plausible that they immigrate from nearby coastal sites, i.e. the southern coast of Madagascar for MR and the islands of La Réunion and Mauritius for LP.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial plants seeds, spores and pollen are often dispersed by wind. Likewise, most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents. It was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish. However, recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought. The modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging. Similar biophysical models are developed, in which outputs of Eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism (wind or currents) are used as inputs to Lagrangian models that include biological components (such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration). These biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities (seeds, larvae) in three dimensions. We reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective, and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs. terrestrial seed dispersal models, the data used for the models output corroboration, and the tools available to perform simulations. We conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected. More broadly, we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology by sharing knowledge, methods, tools, and concepts.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea (MS) is a semi-enclosed sea characterized by a zonal west-east gradient of oligotrophy, where microbial growth is controlled by phosphate availability in most situations. External inputs of nutrients including Gibraltar inputs, river inputs and atmospheric deposition are therefore of major importance for the biogeochemistry of the MS. The latter has long been considered to be driven mainly by nutrient exchanges at Gibraltar. However, recent studies indicate that river inputs significantly affect nutrients concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea, although their resulting impact on its biogeochemistry remains poorly understood. In this study, our aim was to help fill this knowledge gap by addressing the large-scale and long-term impact of variations in river inputs on the biogeochemistry of the Mediterranean Sea over the last decades, using a coupled physical-biogeochemical 3D model (NEMO-MED12/Eco3M-Med). As a first result, it has been shown by the model that the strong diminution (60\%) of phosphate (PO4) in river inputs into the Mediterranean Sea since the end of the 1980s induced a significant lowering of PO4 availability in the sub-surface layer of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin (EMB). One of the main consequences of PO4 diminution is the rise, never previously documented, of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the surface layer (by 20\% on average over the EMB). Another main result concerns the gradual deepening of the top of the phosphacline during the period studied, thus generating a shift between the top of the nitracline and the top of the phosphacline in the EMB. This shift has already been observed in situ and documented in literature, but we propose here a new explanation for its occurrence in the EMB. The last main result is the evidence of the decline in abundance and the reduction of size of copepods calculated by the model over the years 1985–2010, that could partially explain the reduction in size of anchovy and sardine recently recorded in the MS. In this study, it is shown for the first time that the variations in river inputs that occurred in the last decades may have significantly altered the biogeochemical cycles of two key elements (P and C), in particular in the EMB. To conclude, the magnitude of the biogeochemical changes induced by river inputs and runoff alone over the last thirty years clearly calls for the use of realistic scenarios of river inputs along with climate scenarios for coupled physical-biogeochemical forecasts in the MS.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is one of the main hotspots of marine biodiversity in the world. The combined pressures of fishing activity and climate change have also made it a hotspot of global change amidst increasing concern about the worsening status of exploited marine species. To anticipate the impacts of global changes in the Mediterranean Sea, more integrated modelling approaches are needed, which can then help policymakers prioritize management actions and formulate strategies to mitigate impacts and adapt to changes. The aim of this study was to develop a holistic model of marine biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea with an explicit representation of the spatial, multispecies dynamics of exploited resources subject to the combined influence of climate variability and fishing pressure. To this end, we used the individual-based OSMOSE model (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine ecOSystEms), including 100 marine species (fish, cephalopods and crustaceans) representing about 95\% of the total declared catch, at a high spatial resolution (400 km2) and a large spatial scale (the entire Mediterranean basin) – the first time such a resolution and scale have been modelled. We then combined OSMOSE with the NEMOMED 12 physical model and the Eco3M-S biogeochemical low trophic level model to build the end-to-end model, OSMOSE-MED. We fitted OSMOSE-MED model with observed or estimated biomass and commercial catch data using a likelihood approach and an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The outputs of OSMOSE-MED were then verified against observed biomass and catch data, and compared with independent datasets (MEDITS data, diet composition and trophic levels). The model results – at different hierarchical levels, from individuals to the scale of the ecosystem – were consistent with current knowledge of the structure, functioning and dynamics of the ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea. While the model could be further improved in future iterations, all the modelling steps – the comprehensive representation of key ecological processes and feedback, the selective parameterization of the model, and the comparison with observed data in the validation process – strengthened the predictive performance of OSMOSE-MED and thus its relevance as an impact model to explore the future of marine biodiversity under scenarios of global change. It is a promising tool to support ecosystem-based fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Passive larval drift simulations using a dispersal biophysical model showed a large variability in the possible trajectories from spawning to nursery areas and in the predicted ages for larvae arrival on the two nursery sites. The most common ages at arrival obtained in the simulations (20–60 days) are broadly consistent with previous modeling studies but contrast with the actual ages of the S. aurata post-larvae collected in 2016 and 2017 at time of the lagoon entrances (60–90 days, from otolith readings). The period between 25 and 70 days being critical for gilthead seabream larvae to acquire sufficient swimming, osmoregulatory, and olfactory abilities to enter coastal lagoons, we argue that ontogenic development plays a crucial role in the transport and local retention of S. aurata larvae in the studied region, explaining the discrepancy between simulation results and observed data.},

The state of the ecosystem at MMSY is so variable across fishing strategies that it is not possible to set reference points without considering the fishing strategy. However, strategy-specific reference points were found to constitute robust proxies for MMSY in more than 90\% of the simulated fishing strategies. For instance, under the current fishing strategy in the southern Benguela, robust reference points at MMSY could be identified for the following indicators: mean length of fish, mean lifespan, biomass over catch ratio, trophic level of the surveys, mean trophic index, proportion of predatory fish, intrinsic vulnerability index, and mean maximum length.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is now recognized as a hotspot of global change, ranking among the fastest warming ocean regions. In order to project future plausible scenarios of marine biodiversity at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin, the current challenge is to develop an explicit representation of the multispecies spatial dynamics under the combined influence of fishing pressure and climate change. Notwithstanding the advanced state-of-the-art modelling of food webs in the region, no previous studies have projected the consequences of climate change on marine ecosystems in an integrated way, considering changes in ocean dynamics, in phyto- and zoo-plankton productions, shifts in Mediterranean species distributions and their trophic interactions at the whole basin scale. We used an integrated modelling chain including a high-resolution regional climate model, a regional biogeochemistry model and a food web model OSMOSE to project the potential effects of climate change on biomass and catches for a wide array of species in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that projected climate change would have large consequences for marine biodiversity by the end of the 21st century under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 with current fishing mortality). The total biomass of high trophic level species (fish and macroinvertebrates) is projected to increase by 5\% and 22\% while total catch is projected to increase by 0.3\% and 7\% by 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, respectively. However, these global increases masked strong spatial and inter-species contrasts. The bulk of increase in catch and biomass would be located in the southeastern part of the basin while total catch could decrease by up to 23\% in the western part. Winner species would mainly belong to the pelagic group, are thermophilic and/or exotic, of smaller size and of low trophic level while loser species are generally large-sized, some of them of great commercial interest, and could suffer from a spatial mismatch with potential prey subsequent to a contraction or shift of their geographic range. Given the already poor conditions of exploited resources, our results suggest the need for fisheries management to adapt to future changes and to incorporate climate change impacts in future management strategy evaluation.},

	abstract = {While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5\% (±4\% SD) under low emissions and 17\% (±11\% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5\% decline for every 1 °C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.},

Our web application guides the user through simple queries to extract information from FishBase and SeaLifeBase data archives, and it delivers all the configuration files necessary for running an OSMOSE model. Here, we present our web application and demonstrate it for the West Florida Shelf ecosystem.

	abstract = {The Mediterranean region has been shown to be particularly exposed to climate change, with observed trends that are more pronounced than the global tendency. In forecast studies based on a RCP 8.5 scenario, there seems to be a consensus that, along with an increase in temperature and salinity over the next century, a reduction in the intensity of deep-water formation and a shallowing of the mixed layer (especially in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea (MS)) are expected. By contrast, only a few studies have investigated the effects of climate change on the biogeochemistry of the MS using a 3D physical/biogeochemical model. In this study, our aim was to explore the impact of the variations in hydrodynamic forcing induced by climate change on the biogeochemistry of the MS over the next century. For this purpose, high-resolution simulations under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario have been run using the regional climate system model CNRM-RCSM4 including the NEMO-MED8 marine component, coupled (off-line) with the biogeochemical model Eco3M-Med. The results of this scenario first highlight that most of the changes in the biogeochemistry of the MS will occur (under the RCP 8.5 scenario) after 2050. They suggest that the MS will become increasingly oligotrophic, and therefore less and less productive (14 \% decrease in integrated primary production in the Western Basin and in the Eastern Basin). Significant changes would also occur in the planktonic food web, with a reduction (22 \% in the Western Basin and 38 \% in the Eastern Basin) of large phytoplankton species abundance in favour of small organisms. Organisms will also be more and more N-limited in the future since NO3 concentrations are expected to decline more than those of PO4 in the surface layer. All these changes would mainly concern the Western Basin, while the Eastern Basin would be less impacted.},

	abstract = {The marine ecosystem off British Columbia (BC), Canada, has experienced various changes in the last two decades. Understanding how stressors interactively and cumulatively affect commercially important fish species is key to moving towards ecosystem-based fisheries management. Because it is challenging to assess the cumulative effects of multiple stressors by using empirical data alone, a dynamic, individual-based spatially-explicit ecosystem modeling platform such as OSMOSE represents a valuable tool to simulate ecological processes and comprehensively evaluate how stressors cumulatively impact modelled species. In this study, we employed OSMOSE to investigate the cumulative effects of fishing, plankton biomass change, and marine mammal consumption on the dynamics of some fish species and the BC marine ecosystem as a whole. We specifically simulated ecosystem dynamics during the last 20 years under two sets of scenarios: (1) unfavorable conditions from the perspective of commercial fish species (i.e., doubling fishing rates, halving plankton biomass, and doubling marine mammal biomass, acting individually or collectively); and (2) favorable conditions with the three factors having opposite changes (i.e., halving fishing rates, doubling plankton biomass, and halving marine mammal biomass, acting individually or collectively). Our results indicate that, under unfavorable conditions, the degree to which species biomass was reduced varied among species, and that negative synergistic and negative dampened effects were dominant under historical and doubled fishing mortality rates, respectively. Under favorable conditions, species biomasses did not increase as much as expected due to the existence of complex predator-prey interactions among fish species, and positive synergistic and positive dampened effects were prevailing under historical and halved fishing mortality rates, respectively. The ecosystem total biomass and the biomass to fisheries yield ratio were found to be good ecological indicators to represent ecosystem changes and track the impacts from the multiple drivers of change. Our research provides insights on how fisheries management should adapt to prepare for potential future impacts of climate change.},
